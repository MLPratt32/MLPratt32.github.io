                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I've always loved to cook for as long as I can remember. As a child, my mother would come downstairs on Saturday mornings to see me standing on the step stool making scrambled eggs and omlets. As I got older, I began to cook more and more.</p> <p>But it was only when I moved away to college that I truly began to explore ways to make food feel both healthy and gourment. That is what led me to creating the following four recipes.</p> <p> Some are adapted recipes that I changed according to my own taste, while others are original Mira recipes! The recipes themselves are not overly complicated, and none take more than 30 minutes of active cooking time, though the chili needs a bit of time to braise.</p> <p> So please, kick back, relax, and enjoy making an easy gourmet meal!</p>

                <h4>Healthy Cooking</h4>
                <p>Growing up, my family always did our best to make hearty meals that were filled with veggies and protein, but still cut back on large amounts of fats from ingredients like butter and red meat. However, that does not mean you cannot have flavour! Adding in additional spices can add both a greater depth of flavour and a spicier kick!</p>
                <p>Below is a table of some easy and healthy substitutes.</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Original Ingredients</th>
                        <th>Healthy Substitutes</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Ground pork or beef</td>
                        <td>Ground turkey or chicken</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Butter</td>
                        <td>Olive Oil or Avocado Oil</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Rice</td>
                        <td>Cauliflower Rice</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Heavy Cream</td>
                        <td>Greek Yogurt</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>As you can see, there are so many little ways to make every day recipes a little healthier!</p>
